# FaceEmotionDetector  
Real-time facial emotion detection using a convolutional neural network.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

In this project, I set out to create a **real-time facial emotion detection system** ðŸ§  using the power of deep learning. The core of the project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which I meticulously designed and trained to classify emotions from facial expressions ðŸ“¸. The model is capable of identifying emotions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, and several others, making it a versatile tool in emotion analysis.

To bring this model to life, I utilized **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for building and training the network, while **OpenCV** played a crucial role in integrating live video feed ðŸŽ¥. The system detects faces in real-time and predicts their emotions, providing instant feedback on the emotional state of the detected individual.

This project is not just a demonstration of technical skills, but also an exploration into the fascinating intersection of computer vision and human emotions. Whether it's for interviewers, collaborators, or fellow developers, this project showcases the potential of combining cutting-edge technology with innovative thinking ðŸŒŸ.
